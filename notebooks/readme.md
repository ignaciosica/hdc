# Notebooks

This folder houses a collection of tests and experiments, functioning as a creative sandbox for trialing new algorithms as well as iterating on established methodologies. Each notebook commences with a brief introduction, outlining the objectives of the experiments conducted within, and concludes with a detailed account of the results achieved. Additionally, a dedicated section for references is included in every notebook, providing sources and further reading materials.

# Content

### graph
Studies variations over GraphHD graph encoding algorithm. Tests new centrality metrics and its influence on performance and complexity as well as variations over the encoding algorithm itself.


### random_walks
Tests a complete new approach to graph encoding using hdc where graph are encoded based on random walks. 
 
### tgraph
Implements GraphHD using torch as backend instead of numpy. Accelerates training and inference using gpu eficient operations. Focuses on improving performance overall.

### visualize
Tests new form of visualization of hdc data and algorithms to use elsewhere. Tests dimensionality reduction models like TSNE and also ways of visualizing similarities among a dictionary of hypervectors.
